- # **paralogous**

- ## Where the homology is the result of gene duplication so that both copies have descended side by side during the history of an organism (for example, alpha and beta hemoglobin), the genes should be called **paralogous** (para = in parallel).

- # **orthologous**
>> 
- ## Where the homology is the result of speciation so that the history of the gene reflects the history of the species (for example, alpha hemoglobin in man and mouse), the genes should be called **orthologous** (ortho = exact).
